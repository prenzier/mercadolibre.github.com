In MercadoLibre we want to help argentine developers carry out their own e-commerce projects and ideas. That's why a few days ago we've partnered with Wayra - Telefonica's global startup accelerator - to work together towards this goal.

## The partnership with Wayra

The agreement was made in the context of Wayra's mission to support young argentine entrepreneurs by offering them great regional growth possibilities.
We'll participate with investments and technical training for those projects that use our API and are chosen by Wayra in their next call.

## The call

There's time until May 26th to send digital business ideas and projects to be developed in Argentina. You can sign up directly in Wayra's website and those who are chosen will be able to use this investment program.
