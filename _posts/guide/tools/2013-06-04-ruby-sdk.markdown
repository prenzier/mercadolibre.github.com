The Ruby SDK enables you to access the API from a web application developed in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).
It hides all the complexity of OAuth 2.0 and lets you focus on writing application code.

You'll find the source code in the following location: [https://github.com/mercadolibre/ruby-sdk](https://github.com/mercadolibre/ruby-sdk)

With the source code you'll find documentation on how to use the SDK.

The first thing to do is to instance a __Meli__ class. You'll need to give a __clientId__ and a __clientSecret__. You can obtain both after creating your own application. For more information on this please read: [creating an application](http://developers.mercadolibre.com/creating-your-own-application/)

### Including the Lib
Include the lib meli in your project

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'lib/meli'
{% endhighlight %}
Start the development!

### Create an instance of Meli class
Simple like this
{% highlight ruby %}
meli = Meli.new(1234, "a secret")
{% endhighlight %}
With this instance you can start working on MercadoLibre's APIs.

There are some design considerations worth to mention.

1. This SDK is just a thin layer on top of an http client to handle all the OAuth WebServer flow for you.

2. There is JSON parsing.this SDK will include [json](http://rubygems.org/gems/json) gem for internal usage.

3. If you already have the access_token and the refresh_token you can pass in the constructor

{% highlight ruby %}
meli = Meli.new(1234, "a secret", "Access_Token", "Refresh_Token")
{% endhighlight %}
#### Making GET calls

{% highlight ruby %}
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}
response = meli.get("/users/me", params)
{% endhighlight %}
#### Making POST calls

{% highlight ruby %}
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}

 #we are cool, the sdk will convert this body into json for you
body = {:foo => "bar", :bar => "foo"}

response = meli.post("/items", body, params)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Making PUT calls

{% highlight ruby %}
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}

 #we are cool, the sdk will convert this body into json for you
body = {:foo => "bar", :bar => "foo"}

response = meli.put("/items/123", body, params)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Making DELETE calls
{% highlight ruby %}
params = {:access_token => meli.access_token}
response = meli.delete("/questions/123", params)
{% endhighlight %}

## Examples

Don't forget to check out our [examples](https://github.com/mercadolibre/ruby-sdk/tree/master/examples) codes

## I want to contribute!

That is great! Just fork the project in [GitHub](https://github.com/mercadolibre/ruby-sdk). Create a topic branch, write some code, and add some tests for your new code.

Thanks for helping!
