## Overview

This guide explains how to deal with all the resources of our API to successfully list and manage items with shipping mode **me1**.
It also explains how to post tracking numbers to provide the buyers with the tracking information.

Selected sellers are marked for shipping mode me1 internally after an agreement between the seller and ML.

The guide covers in detail the API resources involved:

<pre class="terminal">

</pre>

   {
      "mode":"not_specified",
      "shipping_attributes":{
         "dimensions":"optional",
         "costs":"not_allowed",
         "accepted_methods":[

         ]
      }

## Item Dimensions {#dimensions}

Dimensions are used to calculate shipping the cost. If any measure is missing it is considered invalid.

Length, Width and Height are separated by 'x' and ',' separates the weight.

(Length cm)**x**(Width cm)**x**(Height cm)**,**(Weight gr)<br /><br />

Restrictions:
- **Weight** < 30000  (30 kg)
- L + W  + H < 200

Dimensions should represent the size of the package that will be shipped. All values are mandatory.

Examples:

**10x20x50,3000** is a valid dimension string

**20x44x,3000** is an invalid dimension string

<br />

## Listing an item on me1 mode

It's quite simple to list an item with me1. Post the free shipping options and dimensions of the package whenever they are available.
If sellers do not provide package dimensions on their listing, the category standard dimensions will be used.

### Local Pick Up

The **local_pick_up** attribute enables the option for buyers to choose to pick up the item from the store and don't incur in shipping costs.

Set local_pick_up to *true* for sellers that offer this option to buyers.


## Adding dimensions to existing listings

After being marked with me1 mode, you can add dimensions and shipping to your existing listings.

Altering the dimensions of an item doesn't affect its relevance in search results and there is no restricion to alter dimensions if the item has sales.

Just do a PUT to items as in the example.

Sellers have the option to list items offering one of the *shipping methods* for *free*.

This type of shipping has some benefits: it is a superior shopping experience for the buyer, it is highlited in the search results and buyers can filter listings that offer free shipping.

*NOTE:* For the moment the only option for free shipping is "country"

The API has a specific resource to calculate shipping costs for a given dimension and zip code destination.

It can be useful to check the reference prices to the most common destinations e.g.: To São Paulo or RJ.


There are 2 resources for the shipping calculator to choose the one that better suits your available parameters, both of them return the same result.

All you have to do is a PUT to the shipment with the **service_id** and **tracking_number** attributes.

<pre class="terminal">
https://api.mercadolibre.com/shipments/:shipment_id?access_token=
</pre>

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "tracking_number": "TR1234567891",
  "service_id": 1
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** If the product was sent by some another service send the parameter service_id with value 11.
