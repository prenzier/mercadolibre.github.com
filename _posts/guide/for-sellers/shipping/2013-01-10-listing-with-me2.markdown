## Listing
Just list an item as usual, except you can specify free shipping methods.


## Free shipping

Sellers can list items offering one of the shipping methods for free.

This type of listing has some benefits: it is a superior shopping experience for the buyer, it is highlighted in the search results.

<i class="ch-icon-exclamation-sign">ML will charge the seller on MercadoPago for the costs of free shippings.</i>
<br>
<br>
<i class="ch-icon-exclamation-sign">IMPORTANT: For the moment the only option for free shipping is “country”.
To list offering Standard shipping for free with the country option, add the shipping method array "methods": [{ "id": 100009, "free": "country"}]
</i>

This examples shows a listing with free Standard shipping.

## Local Pick Up

The *local_pick_up* attribute enables the option for buyers to choose to pick up the item from the store and don’t incur in shipping costs.
Set *local_pick_up* to true for sellers that offer this option to buyers.


## Print the label

Once you have a sale with shipping option paid by the buyer, Sellers need to print the label pre-paid by ML.

The shipments have to be in status *ready_to_ship* to be able to get a label.
This means the payment has been processed and there a pre-paid label is available for the seller.

The API to obtain a label, or a set of labels, receives a list of shipment IDs, an access token and returns labels in PDF format.

**Shipping labels URL**
<pre class="terminal">
https://api.mercadolibre.com/shipment_labels?shipment_ids=20178600648,20182100995&access_token=
</pre>

The response will be a PDF file containing one or more pre-paid shipping labels ready to print.
