Listings in MercadoLibre can have 4 different shipping modes

<ol class="ch-list">
<li><strong>not specified</strong>
	<br>
It means the seller did not specify any shipping price for his items and the buyer has to get in contact with the seller to agree on a shipping option and price for the purchase.</li>

<li>
  <strong>custom</strong>
	<br>
  	Sellers can include a table of up to 10 shipping costs on an item.<br> 
  	Each shipping cost has a label that describes the shipping option. e.g.: "2 days by Air" - 40 BRL, "To Buenos Aires" - 50 ARS.<br>
  	There is no tracking and there is no enforcement for the buyer to pay for the cost associated to his address<br>
</li>

<li><strong>me1</strong> (MercadoEnvios mode 1)
	<br>
	This method offers a shipping calculator to collect the shipping cost for every order allowing the seller to choose the shipping service of his choice.
</li>
<li><strong>me2</strong> (MercadoEnvios mode 2)
	<br>
	This method provides the seller a pre-paid label and tracking code with the shipping company chosen by ML.
</li>
</ol>

<br>

<i class="ch-icon-comment-alt">
IMPORTANT:
MercadoEnvios mode 2 is available for sellers of Brasil and Argentina who want to opt-in to participate in the program and it will soon be available in Argentina.
<br>
MercadoEnvios 1 is only available for selected sellers in Brasil who need to reach an agreement with MercadoLibre.

</pre>

This will returns a lot of information about the authenticated user, one of those is the shipping_modes attribute.

    "custom",
    "not_specified",
    "me1"
